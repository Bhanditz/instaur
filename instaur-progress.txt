Dependencies:
curl
package-query
pacman
sudo

Features to add:
- Create PKGBUILD for instaur to install instaur as arch package rather than manual install.
- Parse or run limited PKGBUILDs, read /etc/makepkg.conf for variables such as CARCH
- Search AUR, checkout pacaur's options
- Enhance pacman operation/option recognition: first operation loop, then option loop
- Comprehensive and concise logs:
  /var/instaur-comprehensive.log - every command and result ever
  /var/instaur-concise.log - only up to date packages
- Improve help page, turn into man page, create shorter help page...?
- Automatic Dependency Handling Possibilities:
	* Check state of all AUR packages in instaur.log (up to date?), also remove any dead log listings (packages uninstalled with pacman)
	* --auto option: automatically and recursively install any AUR dependencies needed OR simply make InstAUR always automatically check dependency versions to see if they are up to date.
	* -Syu?
- pacman -Qm:
	remove log that isn't there
	crossmatch Qm items not in log against AUR, add to log if present in AUR with time=unknown
	check each one at AUR for -Ayu
- package-query for -s

Known bugs:
- When makepkg has to pacman -S something, it asks sudo, so with auto dep management make sure it installs before makepkg is run.
- PKGBUILD version number set via variable, instaur displays variable name instead of version number
- instaur.log keeps pacman uninstalled packages (disabled uninstall rm feature, must check whether pacman -R worked)
- sometimes asks for sudo -u user password when already in root. wtf?

Non-bug stability concerns:
- Ensure variables are being treated safely: initialization, resetting, quotation marks, conditional/loop brackets
- Prevent instaur from instauring itself (will become necessary when instaur is added to AUR).


== PACMAN OPTIONS ==
Nothing that reads next argument works unless entire commend is passed to pacman.
Options: Nothing tested except:
	--noconfirm: Works both with instaur and it is passed to pacman.
Transaction: With -U or -R, all is passed, with -S, nothing tested.
Upgrade: With -U, all is passed, with -S, nothing tested except:
	--needed: Works both with instaur and it is passed to pacman.
-Q: Passed to pacman unchanged, no need to ever change this behavior
-R: Passed to pacman unchanged, should improve eventually
-S: None, pass to pacman and do the following for aur:
	-c: (fakesync) clean /tmp, clean instaur.log
	-g: (fakesync) do groups even exist in aur?
	-i: (sync) read from pkgbuild or aur webpage
	-l: (fakesync) list everything in AUR? no way...
	-s: Works, instaur -Ss searches AUR and repos combined (like package-query -ASs)
	-u: (sync) populate list before going into sync loop
	-w: (sync)
	-y: (sync) unnecessary for AUR, pass only


CHANGE LOG
0.9.0 [2015]
Features Added:
- Create and use instaur user and group to avoid password prompts for --noconfirm and avoid necessity for non-root user to already exist. (functionality & stability)
	Delete then add these on every install (install.sh).
	Remove finduser function (instaur-lib.sh).
	Stop using finduser function, set curuser=instaur to run all de-elevated commands with instaur user (instaur.sh).
- install.sh: Create gpg config for instaur user and enable automatic key retrieval (stability)
Bugfixes:
- Remove *$cvnum from pacman -U to fix git installations.
- cvnum package-query -A instead of -AS to prevent version confusion
- Switch makepkg -si back to makepkg -s && pacman -U $p-$cvnum*tar.xz now that version confusion is fixed.

0.8.1 [2015-07-30]
Bugfixes:
- Updated to AUR4
	replace two urls in instaur-lib.sh for package download
	added --aur-url https://aur4.archlinux.org for package-query
- Changed install.sh path to BASEDIR=$(dirname $0)
- Use makepkg -si instead of makepkg -s && pacman -U $p-$cvnum*tar.xz
- Are you sure? and Delete installation? now (intentionally and properly) favor yes.
- Comment out instaur.log.bak crap

0.8.0 [2015-07-02]
Features added:
- Switched pacman -U *xz to pacman -U $p-$cvnum*tar.xz
- Read arguments more explicitly (new loop inspired by my own jwmmmaker script). (stability & functionality)
- More comprehensive pacman argument support. (functionality) - [perpetually in progress]
- pacman -Q && package-query -AS for versions check (stability & performance)
- Download PKGBUILD directly instead of tarball for dependency check (stability & performance)
Bugfixes:
- Stopped asking confirmation or mentioning dependencies when package can't be found.
- Fix --needed for new installation style.
- Version number check switched from $() to backticks (only fix for how it displays in text editor)

Defunct/unnecessary bugfix lost between versions: Fix new PKGBUILD version reading protocol by properly incorperating pkgrel. (defunct)

0.7.0 [2014-10-27]
Features added:
- Check dependencies and version from file in tarball instead of AUR website. (stability)
- Functions restructured to accomplish the above (eg. download tarball earlier)
- Install instaur with install.sh (usability)
- NEW LOCATIONS: (stability)
  /usr/bin/instaur
  /usr/lib/instaur-lib.sh
  /usr/doc/instaur-help.txt
  /var/instaur.log
  /tmp/instaur.log.bak
  /tmp/instaur.log.bak.old
  /tmp/instaur.tmp
  /tmp/instaur-pacman.log
Bugfixes:
- Fixed permission errors associated with going back and forth between root and user for mkdir and makepkg.


0.6.0
Features added:
- Got rid of pacman -Qi error: package '' was not found via 2>/dev/null (usability)
- Reorganize entire script into two files: instaur-functions.sh and instaur.sh (currently dni.sh) calls functions
- Crossmatch local dependencies against online dependencies (stability)
- Improve user dialog, require fewer confirmations. (usability)
Bugfixes:
- Can now run script as root (fakeroot makepkg via sudo -u via finduser function), --noconfirm is now truly no confirmations.

0.5.0
Features added:
- -R operation: Uninstall package and remove from log. (functionality)
- Combine version number and dependency search into single download. (performance)
- Use same dependency search for pre-install and log file. (performance)
- Create instaur.log file with column titles if non-existent. (functionality)
Bugfixes:
- Can now find dependencies for fresh installations (search AUR | pacman -Ss) :instead of: (pacman -Qi | pacman -Ss) (stability)

0.4.0
Features added:
- Integrate options into InstAUR: --noconfirm --help --needed. (functionality)
- Pass any pacman options (untested: use at own risk). (functionality)
- For loop entire code to install multiple packages. (functionality)
Bugfixes:
- sudo -v at beginning to cache for later use (not ideal, but should improve --noconfirm). (stability)
